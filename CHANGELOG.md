## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Ability to customize `UID` and `GID` if you're not using `1000:1000` (check the `.env.example` file)
- Output `docker compose logs` in CI for easier debugging

### Changed

- Replace `Redis.current` (removed in `redis` 5.0+) with `RedisConn.current` which is in `config/initializers/redis.rb`
- Rename `run bash` to `run shell`
- Reference `PORT` variable in the `docker-compose.yml` web service instead of hard coding `8000`
- Adjust Hadolint to exit > 0 if any style warnings are present

### Removed

- `set -o nounset` from `run` script since it's incompatible with Bash 3.2 (default on macOS)

### Fixed

- Assets in production mode were using the wrong `.sprockets-manifest-XXX.json` file, `bin/docker-entrypoint-web` was adjusted to delete all but the last built version since Rails doesn't pick the latest file based on `mtime`
