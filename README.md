# An example Rails + Docker app

![CI](https://github.com/nickjj/docker-rails-example/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=main)

You could use this example app as a base for your new project or as a guide to
Dockerize your existing Rails app.

The example app is minimal but it wires up a number of things you might use in
a real world Rails app, but at the same time it's not loaded up with a million
personal opinions.

For the Docker bits, everything included is an accumulation of [Docker best
practices](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/best-practices-around-production-ready-web-apps-with-docker-compose)
based on building and deploying dozens of assorted Dockerized web apps since
late 2014.

**This app is using Rails 7.0.4.2 and Ruby 3.2.1**. The screenshot doesn't get
updated every time I bump the versions:

If you don't like some of these choices that's no problem, you can swap them
out for something else on your own.

## Main changes vs a newly generated Rails app

Here's a run down on what's different. You can also use this as a guide to
Dockerize an existing Rails app.

- **Core**:
    - Use PostgreSQL (`-d postgresql)` as the primary SQL database
    - Use Redis as the cache back-end
    - Use Sidekiq as a background worker through Active Job
    - Use a standalone Action Cable process
- **App Features**:
    - Add `pages` controller with a home page
    - Add `up` controller with 2 health check related actions
- **Config**:
    - Log to STDOUT so that Docker can consume and deal with log output 
    - Credentials are removed (secrets are loaded in with an `.env` file)
    - Extract a bunch of configuration settings into environment variables
    - Rewrite `config/database.yml` to use environment variables
    - `.yarnc` sets a custom `node_modules/` directory
    - `config/initializers/rack_mini_profiler.rb` to enable profiling Hotwire Turbo Drive
    - `config/initializers/assets.rb` references a custom `node_modules/` directory
    - `config/routes.rb` has Sidekiq's dashboard ready to be used but commented out for safety
    - `Procifile.dev` has been removed since Docker Compose handles this for us
- **Assets**:
    - Use esbuild (`-j esbuild`) and TailwindCSS (`-c tailwind`)
    - Add `postcss-import` support for `tailwindcss` by using the `--postcss` flag
    - Add ActiveStorage JavaScript package
- **Public:**
    - Custom `502.html` and `maintenance.html` pages
    - Generate favicons using modern best practices

Besides the Rails app itself, a number of new Docker related files were added
to the project which would be any file having `*docker*` in its name. Also
GitHub Actions have been set up.

## Running this app

You'll need to have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
It's available on Windows, macOS and most distros of Linux. If you're new to
Docker and want to learn it in detail check out the [additional resources
links](#learn-more-about-docker-and-ruby-on-rails) near the bottom of this
README.

You'll also need to enable Docker Compose v2 support if you're using Docker
Desktop. On native Linux without Docker Desktop you can [install it as a plugin
to Docker](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/). It's been generally
available for a while now and very stable. This project uses a specific Docker
Compose profiles feature that only works with Docker Compose v2.

If you're using Windows, it will be expected that you're following along inside
of [WSL or WSL
2](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/a-linux-dev-environment-on-windows-with-wsl-2-docker-desktop-and-more).
That's because we're going to be running shell commands. You can always modify
these commands for PowerShell if you want.

#### Clone this repo anywhere you want and move into the directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nickjj/docker-rails-example hellorails
cd hellorails

# Optionally checkout a specific tag, such as: git checkout 0.7.0
```

#### Copy an example .env file because the real one is git ignored:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

#### Build everything:

*The first time you run this it's going to take 5-10 minutes depending on your
internet connection speed and computer's hardware specs. That's because it's
going to download a few Docker images and build the Ruby + Yarn dependencies.*

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

Now that everything is built and running we can treat it like any other Rails
app.

Did you receive an error about a port being in use? Chances are it's because
something on your machine is already running on port 8000. Check out the docs
in the `.env` file for the `DOCKER_WEB_PORT` variable to fix this.

Did you receive a permission denied error? Chances are you're running native
Linux and your `uid:gid` aren't `1000:1000` (you can verify this by running
`id`). Check out the docs in the `.env` file to customize the `UID` and `GID`
variables to fix this.

#### Setup the initial database:

```sh
# You can run this from a 2nd terminal.
./run rails db:setup
```

*We'll go over that `./run` script in a bit!*

#### Check it out in a browser:

Visit <http://localhost:8000> in your favorite browser.

#### Running the test suite:

```sh
# You can run this from the same terminal as before.
./run test
```

You can also run `./run test -b` with does the same thing but builds your JS
and CSS bundles. This could come in handy in fresh environments such as CI
where your assets haven't changed and you haven't visited the page in a
browser.

#### Stopping everything:

```sh
# Stop the containers and remove a few Docker related resources associated to this project.
docker compose down
```

You can start things up again with `docker compose up` and unlike the first
time it should only take seconds.

## Files of interest

I recommend checking out most files and searching the code base for `TODO:`,
but please review the `.env` and `run` files before diving into the rest of the
code and customizing it. Also, you should hold off on changing anything until
we cover how to customize this example app's name with an automated script
(coming up next in the docs).

### `.env`
