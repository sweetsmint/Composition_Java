# An example Rails + Docker app

![CI](https://github.com/nickjj/docker-rails-example/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=main)

You could use this example app as a base for your new project or as a guide to
Dockerize your existing Rails app.

The example app is minimal but it wires up a number of things you might use in
a real world Rails app, but at the same time it's not loaded up with a million
personal opinions.

For the Docker bits, everything included is an accumulation of [Docker best
practices](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/best-practices-around-production-ready-web-apps-with-docker-compose)
based on building and deploying dozens of assorted Dockerized web apps since
late 2014.

**This app is using Rails 7.0.4.2 and Ruby 3.2.1**. The screenshot doesn't get
updated every time I bump the versions:
